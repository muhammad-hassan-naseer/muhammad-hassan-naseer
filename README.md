### [Technosoft Codex](https://github.com/muhammad-hassan-naseer/technosoftCodex)

During my collaboration with Technosoft Codex, I had the opportunity to design and develop their official company website.The project involved the following key aspects:
Thoroughly exploring their current website at https://arbisoft.com/ to understand its design, layout, and functionality.
Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the existing design and areas that needed improvement.
Redesigning the website using React.js components, leveraging the power and flexibility of this library.
Creating wireframes and mockups using Figma, a design tool commonly used in the React.js ecosystem, to propose the layout, structure, and content placement of the redesigned website.
Incorporating feedback through an iterative process until we were satisfied with the proposed redesign concept.
Proceeding to the visual design phase by creating high-fidelity designs that considered typography, color schemes, imagery, and other visual elements, all implemented within the React.js framework.
Ensuring the design was responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes using responsive design techniques within React.js.
Maintaining SEO and website ranking by carefully choosing keywords and implementing best practices, while seamlessly integrating them into the React.js codebase.
